# Introduction.

Hi. This README hasn't been made yet. I promise it will be full of awesome things about an awesome development in the realm of partial least squares/canonical correlation/reduced rank regression.

See [Beaton, D., ADNI, Saporta, G., Abdi, H. (2019). A generalization of partial least squares regression and correspondence analysis for categorical and mixed data: An application with the ADNI data. bioRxiv, 598888.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/598888v1.abstract) for now.
