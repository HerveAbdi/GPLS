Generalized Partial Least Squares
================

Introduction
============

The generalized in generalized partial least squares (GPLS) is for both generalization of various PLS and canonical methods (e.g., canonical correlation) and also generalized across different data types (e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, mixed).

This is the (likely temporary, or transitionary) home for GPLS.

The current code for GPLS is *very* preliminary. Updates will be made over the coming weeks.
